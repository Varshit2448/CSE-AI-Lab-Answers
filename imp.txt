To run a machine learning code, you just need:  

1. Jupyter Notebook (for running Python code interactively)  
   - Install it using:  
     ```bash
     pip install jupyterlab
     ```
   - Run it using:  
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

2. Dataset Requirements  
   - Ensure you have a dataset in formats like **CSV, JSON, Excel, or Image files**.  
   - Example: If using a CSV file, load it in Jupyter with:  
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
     ```

That's all you need to run ML code! ðŸš€
