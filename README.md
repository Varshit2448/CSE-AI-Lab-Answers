# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LABORATORY 

This repository contains various AI and machine learning programs implemented for different tasks such as unification, resolution-based inference, SVM-based image classification, fuzzy control systems, and early image processing techniques.  

## **1. Unification Algorithm for NLP**  
### **Description:**  
This program implements a unification algorithm to find consistent variable assignments in natural language processing (NLP). Given a set of sentences with variables and constants, the algorithm ensures logical consistency.  

### **Key Features:**  
- Parses and unifies sentences using substitution rules.  
- Useful in logic-based AI applications.  

---

## **2. Resolution-Based Inference Engine**  
### **Description:**  
This program implements a resolution-based inference system for logical reasoning. It applies resolution principles to infer new facts from a knowledge base.  

### **Key Features:**  
- Uses propositional logic for automated reasoning.  
- Helps in knowledge representation and theorem proving.  

---

## **3. SVM-Based Image Classification**  
### **Description:**  
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is implemented to recognize digits from an image dataset using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.  

### **Key Features:**  
- Uses **HOG feature extraction** to process images.  
- Trains an **SVM model** to classify images.  
- Can be extended for real-world image classification tasks.  

---

## **4. Fuzzy Control System for Room Temperature**  
### **Description:**  
A fuzzy logic-based temperature control system that adjusts room temperature based on user preferences and environmental changes.  

### **Key Features:**  
- Defines fuzzy membership functions for **temperature, preference, and adjustment**.  
- Uses fuzzy rules to decide temperature adjustments dynamically.  
- Simulates how room temperature adapts over time.

## **5. Early Image Processing - Histogram Equalization**  
### **Description:**  
This program implements **histogram equalization** to enhance lung cancer images by improving contrast and making details more visible.  

### **Key Features:**  
- Enhances image quality by improving brightness distribution.  
- Suitable for **medical image processing** applications.

## **Setup & Requirements**  
To run these programs, you need the following dependencies:  
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn skfuzzy
```
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed before running the programs.

## **Usage Instructions**  
1. **Unification Algorithm:** Run `unification.py` to test unification of logical expressions.  
2. **Resolution-Based Inference:** Run `resolution.py` with a knowledge base to infer new facts.  
3. **SVM-Based Image Classification:** Train the SVM model using `svm_classifier.py` and test with a sample image.  
4. **Fuzzy Temperature Control:** Run `fuzzy_control.py` to simulate temperature adjustments.  
5. **Histogram Equalization:** Run `image_enhancement.py` with a lung cancer image to see the effect of histogram equalization.
